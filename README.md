## About Me

Hi, I'm Sora Morimoto. I mainly use functional programming languages.
Nevertheless, I'm not cynical about other programming languages and paradigms,
even though I prefer the formalisable aspects, rather than the often subjective
appeal to taste or intuition. I'm currently living at the intersection between
the industry and academia while working on language platforms or operating
systems for a weird world in multidisciplinary teams.
